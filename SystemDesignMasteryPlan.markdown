# Comprehensive System Design Mastery Plan for AI/ML Engineers

This mastery plan is designed specifically for AI/ML engineers aiming to excel in system design. It spans 16 weeks, divided into four phases, focusing on building foundational skills, ensuring high availability and performance, mastering distributed systems, and tackling advanced case studies. The plan emphasizes a balance between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, with hands-on projects, deliverables, and resources to guide your progress. Where needed, I've added brief explanations in *italics* to clarify concepts, tools, or why certain patterns/practices are useful in AI/ML contexts.

üéØ ## Phase 1: Foundation & Design Patterns (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1-2: Core Design Patterns Implementation

#### Objectives:
- Master 15 essential design patterns with ML use cases
- Build pattern recognition skills for system architecture

#### Learning Path:
##### Creational Patterns (Days 1-3)
- **Singleton**: ML model registry, configuration manager  
  _*Explanation: Ensures a single instance (e.g., a global model registry) to avoid conflicts in shared resources like configurations in ML workflows.*_
- **Factory**: Model selection pipeline (GPT vs BERT vs custom)  
  _*Explanation: Abstracts object creation, allowing dynamic selection of ML models based on input without hardcoding classes.*_
- **Builder**: Complex ML pipeline construction  
  _*Explanation: Step-by-step construction of intricate objects, ideal for building multi-stage ML pipelines with optional components.*_
- **Prototype**: Model template cloning for A/B testing  
  _*Explanation: Efficiently creates copies of models for testing variations without rebuilding from scratch.*_

##### Structural Patterns (Days 4-6)
- **Adapter**: Legacy ML model API integration  
  _*Explanation: Bridges incompatible interfaces, useful for integrating old ML models into new systems without rewriting code.*_
- **Facade**: Unified ML inference interface  
  _*Explanation: Simplifies complex subsystems by providing a single entry point for ML inference calls.*_
- **Composite**: Ensemble model architecture  
  _*Explanation: Treats individual models and ensembles uniformly, enabling hierarchical structures like boosting or bagging.*_
- **Decorator**: Model wrapper with logging, caching, monitoring  
  _*Explanation: Adds behaviors (e.g., logging) to models dynamically without altering their core code.*_

##### Behavioral Patterns (Days 7-10)
- **Observer**: Real-time model performance monitoring  
  _*Explanation: Allows multiple observers (e.g., dashboards) to react to changes in model state, like performance drops.*_
- **Strategy**: Dynamic algorithm selection based on data characteristics  
  _*Explanation: Enables swapping algorithms at runtime, e.g., choosing regression vs. classification based on data.*_
- **Chain of Responsibility**: ML preprocessing pipeline  
  _*Explanation: Passes requests through a chain of handlers, perfect for sequential data preprocessing steps.*_
- **Command**: Batch job execution system  
  _*Explanation: Encapsulates requests as objects, enabling queuing and undo for batch ML jobs.*_

#### Practical Projects:
- Build an ML model serving system using Factory + Strategy patterns

  - Model versioning, A/B testing, canary deployments
  - Load balancing between model versions
  - Request routing and response caching  
    _*Explanation: LLD focuses on detailed class-level design; here, it ensures smooth model updates without downtime.*_
- **Design a Feature Store**  
  - Online/offline feature serving
  - Feature versioning and lineage
  - Real-time vs batch feature computation  
    _*Explanation: A feature store centralizes features for ML, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency across training/serving.*_
- **Design a Distributed Training System**  
  - Parameter server architecture
  - Data parallelism coordination
  - Fault tolerance and checkpointing  
    _*Explanation: Handles large-scale training by distributing workloads, with mechanisms to recover from failures.*_
- **Design a Real-time Recommendation Engine**  
  - User behavior tracking
  - Model inference pipeline
