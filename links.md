# Updated Curated Resource List for System Design Mastery in AI/ML

This revised list incorporates the additional YouTube channel [@ConceptAndCodingByShrayansh](https://www.youtube.com/@ConceptAndCodingByShrayansh), which offers in-depth tutorials on system design concepts, coding patterns, and distributed systems relevant to AI/ML engineers. I've integrated it into the appropriate sections for seamless learning. Resources remain focused on high-quality, practical content from blogs and YouTube.

## Phase 1: Foundation \& Design Patterns

Focus on mastering creational, structural, and behavioral patterns with AI/ML applications, plus LLD problem-solving.

- **Blogs:**
    - Evidently AI's database of 650 ML system design case studies, including pattern applications in real-world ML pipelines.[^1]
    - DesignGurus.io guide on system design fundamentals, with examples of patterns in scalable architectures.[^2]
- **YouTube Channels/Videos:**
    - ByteByteGo channel for clear explanations of design patterns in system architecture (e.g., "How Does Kafka Work?" for behavioral patterns).[^3]
    - Exponent channel for FAANG-level pattern breakdowns, like "Designing a Parking Garage" with structural patterns.[^3]
    - [@ConceptAndCodingByShrayansh](https://www.youtube.com/@ConceptAndCodingByShrayansh) for practical implementations of design patterns like Singleton and Factory in Python/Java, with ML use cases such as model selection pipelines.


## Phase 2: High Availability \& Performance Optimization

Cover geo-redundancy, load balancing, caching, CDNs, reliability engineering, and latency/throughput tradeoffs.

- **Blogs:**
    - Meridian IT's guide to high availability architecture, including redundancy and fault tolerance best practices.[^4]
    - Aerospike's comprehensive guide to high availability in cloud computing, with clustering and failover details.[^5]
    - GlobalDots' explanation of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), including architecture and key components for global asset serving.[^6]
- **YouTube Channels/Videos:**
    - CodeKarle channel for beginner-friendly scalability and high availability concepts, including load balancing techniques.[^7][^3]
    - Hussein Nasser's channel for deep dives into reliability engineering and performance metrics.[^7]
    - [@ConceptAndCodingByShrayansh](https://www.youtube.com/@ConceptAndCodingByShrayansh) for videos on caching strategies (e.g., LRU implementation) and high availability setups like active-passive failover.


## Phase 3: Distributed Architectures and Data Strategies

Explore CAP/PACELC theorems, distributed databases, consistent hashing, microservices, service discovery, and message queues.

- **Blogs:**
    - Yugabyte's post on consensus-based replication in distributed databases, covering Raft/Paxos and consistency models.[^8]
    - GeeksforGeeks' article on distributed consensus, including challenges and algorithms like Paxos.[^9]
    - Dev.to's list of top engineering blogs for distributed systems, featuring Google Research on parallel systems.[^10]
- **YouTube Channels/Videos:**
    - Gaurav Sen's channel (System Design Interview) for distributed database and hashing explanations.[^7]
    - Mikhail's System Design Interview channel for consensus protocols and microservices resilience.[^7]
    - [@ConceptAndCodingByShrayansh](https://www.youtube.com/@ConceptAndCodingByShrayansh) for detailed breakdowns of CAP theorem, consistent hashing, and Kafka-based message queues with AI examples.


## Phase 4: Advanced System Design Techniques

Include interview frameworks, performance tuning, event-driven patterns, back-of-the-envelope calculations, and case studies.

- **Blogs:**
    - Solace's complete guide to event-driven architecture, with principles like CQRS and event sourcing.[^11]
    - DesignGurus.io's system design interview prep guide, covering frameworks and trade-offs.[^2]
    - NamasteDev's deep dive into Netflix architecture, including microservices and CDN integration.[^12]
    - Jobins.jp's analysis of Netflix system design for scale, with backend services and content delivery.[^13]
    - Evidently AI's list of 50 best ML engineering blogs for advanced optimization and case studies.[^14]
- **YouTube Channels/Videos:**
    - DesignGurus channel for interview-specific content on advanced techniques and calculations.[^3]
    - 15 Minute System Design channel for quick overviews of event-driven patterns and real-world case studies.[^7]
    - [@ConceptAndCodingByShrayansh](https://www.youtube.com/@ConceptAndCodingByShrayansh) for advanced topics like event-driven ML architectures, back-of-the-envelope estimates, and FAANG-style case studies (e.g., designing scalable recommendation systems).
